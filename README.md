This project uses Euler's method to solve differential equations with respect to time, given some initial conditions. 



The function uses the pre-conditioned steepest descent algorithm to find the vector representing the solution in specific time k.



It also utilises the power method to find the maximum eigenvalue of several of the given matrices. 



Finding the eigenvalue is used to compute the step "h", that can approximate the solution.
